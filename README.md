# NETFLIX-FRONT

I created a Netflix-inspired front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on delivering a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The design incorporates a sleek dark theme, reminiscent of the actual Netflix interface, which enhances the viewing experience.

The layout features a grid of movie posters, each displayed with hover effects that reveal additional information, such as titles, ratings, and brief descriptions. This interactive element engages users and encourages exploration of different content.

I implemented a responsive navigation bar that allows easy access to various sections, including categories like "Trending," "Top Picks," and "My List." The navigation adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

Additionally, I utilized CSS animations to create smooth transitions, enhancing the overall aesthetic. This project not only showcases my skills in front-end development but also reflects my passion for creating engaging web applications that mimic popular platforms like Netflix.
